# crystal-cookbook
Your guide to doing anything in crystal

## Pitch
When I first started getting into crystal, and even now, I find myself spending way too much time trying to figure out how to do basic things like read a file, or how to live life without a for loop. This got me thinking, why? There are good crystal resources out there, so why were they not helpful. In my opinion it comes down to the following

Crystal currently has 3 main resources:
1. [The crystal book](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.8/) - Language specification + few brief guides
2. [Awesome-crystal](https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal) - Curated list of resources
3. [The crystal api](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.8.2/) - Stdlib specification

All of these are handy if you already know what you're looking for, but usually if you're just wondering ***how** do I x thing?* There really isn't much.

For most popular languages, resources for these naturally form in the form of stackoverflow answers, various guide sites (w3schools, geek4geeks etc.) and you can just do a google search. Crystal is too small, and most of the chatter happens on the non-public discord and matrix. So instead we must create this resource manually.

The crystal cookbook aims to be just that. 

## Goals
- guides on how to do all common tasks
- A couple of non-trivial guides to understand how to do larger projects
- shard recommendations for common tasks - hopefully working with awesome-crystal on this
- curated explanations of how to use the standard library

### Stretch Goals
- integration with [carcin](https://github.com/jhass/carc.in)

## Problems
- Too much ideological overlap with crystal book?

## Implementation 
Simple static site made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
